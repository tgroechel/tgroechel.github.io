						<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
							<p>We sit most of the day (probably as you read this even). Traditional education is no different. We sit in chairs and watch lectures for years out of the necessity for eifficient education. Although efficient, sitting inherently leads to student disengagement. Think back to the last time you sat in a talk or lecture, could you stay attentive the whole time?</p>
							<p>Looking at back at early on education, however, teachers use many different techniques that keep young students engaged. This includes having students get up and move around, point at objects, and use a wider student action space.
							</p>
							<p>Why not use a robot tutor to leverage a movement action space that helps students learn through their action space?

							<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
								<p>We want to create a kinesthetically curious robot tutor that helps create kinesthetically curious students. In order to do this, we plan to use hands-free augmented reality (AR) to create spatial content that both the robot tutor and student can interact with in real space. We have <a href="publications/Using_Socially_Expressive_Mixed_Reality_Arms.pdf">recently published</a> how robot tutors can benefit from an AR action space for social expressivity. We hope to expand this idea further for these robot tutors.
								</p>
								<p>We want to leverage the robot's mobile action space as well as we believe it will encourage student movement. Traditionally, robot tutors have used either a tablet or computer and a stationary robot that has limited, non-mobile movement. Hands free AR alleviates the concern of serving content that the robot can observe while allowing for movement. The content is also directly observable to the robot as it is digitally served to the student allowing for precise actions, something very difficult for physical robots.
